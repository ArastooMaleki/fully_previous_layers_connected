in this folder we implement one idea witch i have 
its about to connect a layer to all its before layers
in neural networks witch i familiar with each layer has access to previous layer output .
but what if each layer has access to all the outputs from previous layers ?
for example in 5 layers neural net , layer 5 has acces and use A0 , A1 , A2 ,A3 ,A4  
i will use keras functional api for structure this idea 

the functioanl_api notebook it's simple tutorial of functional api 
the fully_previous_layers_connect it's about implementing this idea 

when i search in the internet i find out there are some ideas like
resnet (Residual Connection) witch is similar to my idea .
